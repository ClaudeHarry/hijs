= hijs

intro:

  hijs is a dead-simple syntax highlighter for JavaScript code on the browser.

  By default, it highlights everything inside <code> blocks.

  If you have command-line snippets, such as:

      $ ls -l > /dev/null

  it will skip those, cause they ain't no JavaScript.

philosophy:

  hijs is a simple solution to a potentially complicated problem. It won't
  fit all your needs, but if what you're trying to achieve is simple enough,
  hijs might be the tool for you.

styling:

  hijs wraps tokens in <span> tags. You can style them like so:

      code .keyword              { font-weight: bold }
      code .string, code .regexp { color: green }
      code .number               { color: pink }
      code .class                { color: blue }
      code .comment              { color: grey }

usage:

  <script src="hijs.js"></script>
